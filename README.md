# Demo site for Umbraco Search

This repo contains the sample site for my [blog post](https://kjac.dev/posts/trying-out-the-new-umbraco-search/) about implementing a search solution with Umbraco Search.

Check the blog post for details ðŸ™‚

To run the sample, open `\src\Site` in a terminal and start the Umbraco site with `dotnet run`.
